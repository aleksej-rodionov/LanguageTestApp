Tasks:

- finish loading images just uploaded after s3 implemented




Bugs:

- launchSingleTop = true when navigate to fragment
- Snackbar shown in the activity scaffold doesn't affect FAB in childScreen's scaffold



Later on:

- how to handle the situation if you get in that gap when the accessToken is expired on backEnd,
but its expiration timestamp in sharedPref is not reached yet (because of that milliseconds
the getAccessToken() network call has taken)?
